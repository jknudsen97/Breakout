# Overview

I created the classic arcade game "Breakout" in pygame using python.

This game includes a paddle, a ball, and a brick wall. The purpose of the game is for the ball to hit all the bricks before hitting the bottom of the screen three times otherwise you will lose and a game over screen will be displayed.

## Development Environment
* repl.it

* pygame 2.0.2
* python 3.8.8

## Useful Websites

* [W3 Schools Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
* [Real Python Pygame](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/)

## Future Work

* Have the ball move in real time instead of only when something is moving on screen.
* For the ball to not hit an angle such that it ends up moving horizontally indefinitely.
